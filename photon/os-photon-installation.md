# Photon Installation

## Getting Super Powers

### Change the Hostname [^1]

Changing Hostname of the appliance is easy:

```
hostnamectl set-hostname photon-master
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
